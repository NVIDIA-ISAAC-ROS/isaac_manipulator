"""
This file is the main meta launch file that launches manipulator-supported workflows.

This file launches 3 other launch files:

1. Sensor launch file which exposes RGB camera streams, camera info streams (intrinsic), and
   depth via regular SGM-based (with infrared emitter) for RealSense or ESS (DNN) for stereo
   cameras.
   Calibration-specific information of the setup (camera w.r.t robot base).
   For sim-based setup, we get those streams from Isaac Sim.
2. Robot driver launch file includes driver nodes for the UR robot and Robotiq 2F gripper that
   expose joint states and load the robot description files. For sim, it includes topic-based
   control of the robot in sim through ros2_control.
3. Core launch file. This includes cuMotion for GPU-accelerated motion planning, nvblox for
   3D reconstruction of the environment, and either DOPE or the combination of RT-DETR and
   FoundationPose for object detection and pose estimation.
