  # Supported objects for Multi-Object Pick and Place
  #
  # STRUCTURE:
  # - Keys are user-defined object names
  # - Each object contains:
  #   - class_id: Object class ID
  #   - grasp_file_path: Path to YAML file with grasp poses
  #   - mesh_file_path: Path to object mesh file
  #
  # CLASS ID MAPPING:
  # - For RT-DETR: class_id corresponds to predefined class IDs from the model's training dataset
  # - For GroundingDINO: class_id corresponds to the index of the object in the detection prompt
